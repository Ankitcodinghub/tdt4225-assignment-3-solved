In this assignment you‚Äôll be working in groups of (max) 3 students to solve some database tasks using the MongoDB database (version 4.2.15) and coding in Python.

Most groups have access to a virtual machine at IDI‚Äôs cluster, running Ubuntu. This machine will have MongoDB already installed and set up for you to use.

This assignment will look at an open dataset of trajectories, and your task is to create collections, clean and insert data, and fetch the data to answer some questions. Your Python program will handle this functionality. The program is inspired by the social media workout application Strava, where users can track activities like running, walking, biking etc and post them online with stats about their workout.

Along with this assignment sheet, you have been given several files:

<ul>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;Dataset ‚Äì Modified dataset based on Geolife GPS Trajectory dataset (please usethis dataset, instead of the one from the website. The dataset from the websitecontains some files that may give you an error).</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;DbConnector.py-aPythonclassthatconnectstoMySQLonthevirtualmachine.</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;example.py-aPythonclasswithexamplesonhowtocreatetables,insert,fetch and delete data in MySQL.</li>

<li>‚óè &nbsp;labeled_ids.txt-afilecontainingtheIDofalluserswhohavelabeledtheirdata. This is found in the dataset.zip file.</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;User-Guide-1.3.pdf-anofficialuserguidetotheGeolifedataset.Thisisfound in the dataset.zip file.This assignment is very similar to assignment 2 where you used MySQL. The dataset is the same, and the tasks are the same. The switch from an SQL-database to a NoSQL-database is the real challenge here.
It is strongly recommended that you read through and understand the whole assignment sheet before you start solving the tasks. There are also some tips at the bottom of this assignment, which could be very handy!

Dataset ‚Äì Geolife GPS Trajectory dataset

Geolife GPS Trajectory dataset is an open source dataset collected by Microsoft from 2007-2011. This dataset recorded a broad range of users‚Äô outdoor movements, including not only life routines like going home and going to work but also some entertainments and sports activities, such as shopping, sightseeing, dining, hiking, and cycling. The user data is mainly from Beijing, China, but also from the US and Europe.

The dataset is provided in the dataset.zip and has some differences from the one online, for the purpose of this assignment. It contains 182 users that have tracked 18 669 activities in total. Each activity contains a number of GPS-points, which we call TrackPoints. In total there are over 24 million trackpoints in this dataset.

In the dataset.zip you will find the official user guide for the dataset. Be sure to read through this before you start the task. Here is also a short summary of the dataset, understanding this is crucial for completing the assignment:

The folder named Data contains all the 182 users, labeled from ‚Äú000‚Äù to ‚Äú181‚Äù. Each user has a Trajectory-folder where each activity is stored as a .plt file. Each .plt file contains several trackpoints.

Line 1‚Ä¶6 in the .plt files are useless in this dataset, and can be ignored. Trackpoints are described in following lines, one for each line:

Field 1: Latitude in decimal degrees.

Field 2: Longitude in decimal degrees.

Field 3: All set to 0 for this dataset, i.e. you don‚Äôt need this field.

Field 4: Altitude in feet (-777 if not valid).

Field 5: Date ‚Äì number of days (with fractional part) that have passed since 12/30/1899.

Field 6: Date as a string.

Field 7: Time as a string.

Note that field 5 and field 6&amp;7 represent the same date/time in this dataset. You may use either of them.

Example:

39.906631, 116.385564, 0, 492, 40097.5864583333, 2009-10-11, 14:04:30 39.906554, 116.385625, 0, 492, 40097.5865162037, 2009-10-11, 14:04:35

Some users have also labeled their data with transportation modes. Possible transportation modes are: walk, bike, bus, taxi, car, subway, train, airplane, boat, run and

A quick note on MongoDB and NoSQL. There is some terminology that is different from the regular relational-database. MongoDB stores data in documents. Documents are JSON documents based on the JSON specification.

An example of a JSON document would be as follows:

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Notice that documents are not just key-value pairs but can include arrays and subdocuments. The data itself can be different data types like geospatial, decimal, string etc. This does not have to be pre-defined, neither does two documents in the same collection have to include the same fields.

A database in MongoDB is the container for collections. A collection is a container for documents. This grouping is similar to relational databases and is pictured below:

Collections

As mentioned earlier, collections in MongoDB are not as strict as in relational databases. How you decide to organize your collections and documents is up to you. The data we are interested in is the same as from Assignment 2 and is displayed in the figure below. Notice that foreign keys are not really a thing in MongoDB, but it is optional how you want to reference things in each document.

Because MongoDB offers a lot of ways to handle this, we encourage you to investigate what solution that might suit the purpose of this assignment best.

Here‚Äôs three great articles that we recommend reading before making a decision: MongoDB Schema Design ‚Äì Part 1 (5 min reading time)

MongoDB Schema Design ‚Äì Part 2 (5 min reading time) MongoDB Schema Design ‚Äì Part 3 (5 min reading time)

Remember what you did in Assignment 2 and what approach that would fit the tasks.

Notice how the id is written as ‚Äú_id‚Äù. In MongoDB, there will always be a ‚Äú_id‚Äù as an ObjectID if the field is not specified (read more here). E.g., creating a document like this:

Person = {

id: 1,

name: ‚ÄòName Namesen‚Äô }

would result in a Person-document like this when inserted to the database: Person = {

_id: ObjectID(‚ÄòSome12byteNumber‚Äô) id: 1,

name: ‚ÄòName Namesen‚Äô

}

You have to manually override the ‚Äú_id‚Äù-field if you want to set a defined ID (e.g. ‚Äò014‚Äô for Users).

Datetime should be consistent throughout your collections, e.g. in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.

Setup database

These steps will guide you through how to connect to the virtual machine from your computer and create a MongoDB-database user with privileges.

<ol>
<li>First, you need to use NTNU‚Äôs VPN to access the virtual machines. Log onto NTNU-VPN with your Feide user (check out this link if you have not done this before).</li>
<li>Open your terminal and enter the following command:

ssh your_username@tdt4225-xx.idi.ntnu.nowhere ‚Äúyour_username‚Äù is the Feide-username and ‚Äúxx‚Äù is your group number for this project (01, 02, 03‚Ä¶ etc).

(If this message pops up, enter yes:yes)

You will then be asked to enter your password, use the Feide-password here. If the password is correct, you have now successfully logged in!</li>

First, type sudo mkdir -p /data/db, then type sudo mongod ‚Äìrepair (bothonlyhavetobedonethefirsttimeyoustartyourserver).If prompted to provide a password, type in your Feide password. Once that is completed type sudo mongod ‚Äìbind_ip_all. If successful, you have now a running MongoDB-server (the bind_ip_all flag opens for connections from any IP-address, but don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll use authentication). This server must be running whenever you are working with the task. Only one of the group members has to run the server at a time.N.B. if you get error messages running sudo mongod ‚Äìrepair or sudo mongod ‚Äìbind_ip_all it is likely that an instance of mongod is already running and that you get a problem with unavailable port(s). In this case, try the following chain of commands:Continue to step 4</li>
<li>Open a new terminal window and ssh into the virtual machine. Do not close the server-window you have running. To open a client-window for MongoDB type sudo mongo. Now, you have your MongoDB-server running in one terminal window, and a MongoDB-client running in the other. If you check your server, the client-login should‚Äôve been logged there.</li>
<li>Now we want to create an admin MongoDB-user. The MongoDB-client accepts shell commands written in JavaScript.

Start by creating an admin-user by typing the following commands:, this chooses the admin database}), this creates a user with the root-role. Change your_username and your_password with desired names. The command can be written in one line, it is spread across several lines here for readability. Here is an example where your_username=adminuser and pwd=admin123:</li>

Setup Python

We will be using a MongoDB connector to Python (PyMongo) in this assignment. If you for some reason would like to complete the assignment in another language, you are allowed to do so. (NB! We will not provide support or documentation for other languages, so we strongly encourage you to use Python.)

With the files provided in this assignment, you will find a requirements.txt, DbConnector.py and example.py, among others.

1. To set up the required pip-packages for this assignment, simply run

pip install -r requirements.txt while you are in the directory with the requirements-file. This will install the connector, along with tabulate (used to print pretty tables in python) and haversine (used to calculate distance between two coordinates).

</ol>
Tasks

The tasks are divided into three parts: Part 1 will focus on cleaning and inserting the data into defined tables. Part 2 will focus on writing queries to the database to gain knowledge of the dataset. Part 3 will focus on writing a report where you discuss your answers.

We recommend looking at the documentation for the MongoDB-Python connector before you start coding.

Part 1

In this task you‚Äôll clean and insert the Geolife dataset into your own MongoDB database, to be able to solve the questions in Part 2. In the section ‚ÄúGeolife GPS Trajectory dataset‚Äú above, you‚Äôll find all the information you need about the dataset you are handed, and in the section ‚ÄúCollection‚Äù you‚Äôll find some nice articles for how to structure the dataset in your MongoDB database. Please discuss in your report how you structure your collections and documents.

Write a Python program that does the following:

<ol>
<li>Connects to the MongoDB server on your Ubuntu virtual machine.</li>
<li>Creates and defines the collections User, Activity and TrackPoint</li>
<li>Inserts the data from the Geolife dataset into your MongoDB database</li>
</ol>
‚óã Here, we require a bit of data cleaning and integration. Study the dataset closely to understand which data goes where.

<ul>
<li>‚óã &nbsp;Iterating through the dataset in the directories can be done using os.walk method, but you are free to use other methods if you find them better for your solution.</li>
<li>‚óã &nbsp;When matching transportation_mode from the labels.txt files to the activities, we only consider exact matches on starttime and end time, i.e. if you find a match in start time, but not in end time, or vice versa, it should not be included. Additionally, there are some labeled activities in labels.txt that will not have a match amongst the activities.</li>
<li>‚óã &nbsp;Important! Sometimes it is wise to limit the dataset we‚Äôre working with. 24 million TrackPoints is a lot. Therefore we only want you to insert activities that have fewer than or exactly 2500 trackpoints in them, i.e. when inserting activities into the database, check that the size of the .plt-files do not exceed 2500 lines (excluding the headers, of course). When you insert TrackPoints, the same rule applies.</li>
<li>‚óã &nbsp;Inserting the trackpoints may take a while! Instead of inserting one document of trackpoints at a time, find out if there is a way to insert bulks of data instead.Part 2Some of the tasks can be answered using MongoDB-queries only, while some might require both queries and Python code to manipulate the data correctly. Use pprint to pretty-print the data output from MongoDB.
Answer the following questions by writing a Python program using MongoDB-queries (like in example.py):
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>How many users, activities and trackpoints are there in the dataset (after it is inserted into the database).</li>
<li>Find the average, minimum and maximum number of activities per user.</li>
<li>Find the top 10 users with the highest number of activities.</li>
<li>Find the number of users that have started the activity in one day and endedthe activity the next day.</li>
<li>Find activities that are registered multiple times. You should find the queryeven if you get zero results.</li>
<li>An infected person has been at position (lat, lon) (39.97548, 116.33031) attime ‚Äò2008-08-24 15:38:00‚Äô. Find the user_id(s) which have been close to this person in time and space (pandemic tracking). Close is defined as the same minute (60 seconds) and space (100 meters). (This is a simplification of the ‚Äúunsolvable‚Äù problem given i exercise 2).</li>

b) Which user had the most activities this year and month, and how many recorded hours do they have? Do they have more hours recorded than the user with the second most activities?

<ol start="10">
<li>Find the total distance (in km) walked in 2008, by user with id=112.</li>
<li>Find the top 20 users who have gained the most altitude meters.1. Output should be a table with (id, total meters gained per user). 2. Remember that some altitude-values are invalid

3. Tip: (tpn.altitude-tpn-1.altitude), tpn.altitude &gt;tpn-1.altitude</li>
<li>Find all users who have invalid activities, and the number of invalid activities per user</li>
</ol>
1. An invalid activity is defined as an activity with consecutive trackpoints where the timestamps deviate with at least 5 minutes.

Part 3

Write a short report (see report-template.docx in the tdt4225-assignment2.zip) where you will display and discuss your results from the tasks. Include screenshots from both part 1 (showing top 10 rows from all of your tables is sufficient) and part 2 (all the results to each task).

Hand in both the report (as PDF) and your code to BlackBoard within Oct 22, at 16:00.

Tips

<ul>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;Using the MongoDB terminal on your Ubuntu machine could be useful for checking simple queries without having to use Python and the connector.
<ul>
<li>‚óã &nbsp;Be sure to have a server running,</li>
<li>‚óã &nbsp;Open the MongoDB client terminal by typing , log in withFeide-password and type to do this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;Using dictionaries/hashmaps are faster for lookups than lists/arrays in yourPython code</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;When extracting transportation_mode from the labels.txt files, rememberthat you only have to consider the user-ids found in the labeled_ids.txt, asthey are the only users where transportation_mode may not be null.</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;Start_time and end_time for activities can be found by looking at the date andtime for the first and last trackpoint in each .plt-file</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;Use some time to consider the different choices for how to store your data.</li>
</ul>
‚óã Embedded documents, one-way referencing or to -way referencing. ‚óè Remember to insert data with the right type. Insert integer as int, date as

some dateformat, etc..

‚óã MongoDB support e.g ISODate

<ul>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;As stated, using Haversine for calculating distance is recommended</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;Comparison between SQL and MongoDB.</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;Comparison between SQL-functions and MongoBD-functions.</li>
